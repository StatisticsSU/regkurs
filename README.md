# R-package for the course Regressions- och tidsserieanalys 7.5 hp

A package specifically designed for a very first course in Regression and Time Series Analysis using R.
Contains functions to summarize the output from regression (lm and glm) in a format closer to that of SAS and Minitab. 
The idea is to help the transitioning courses to R.
The package also contains functions to simulate from regression and logistic regression.
More will come.
