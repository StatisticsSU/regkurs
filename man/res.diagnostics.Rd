\title{Illustrate the results from residual analysis}
\usage{
res.diagnostics(
  lm_obj,
  block = F,
  outliers = F,
  normality = F,
  outnorm = F,
  regressors = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{block}{\code{TRUE} all the plots will be in one panel.}

\item{outliers}{\code{TRUE} only plots regarding the residuals will be produced in two scatter plots and a boxplot.
The first scatter scatter plot is between the actual residuals from \code{lm} function and the fitted values.
The second scatter plot it the studentized reiduals vs the fitted values. The boxplot is from the studentized residuals.}

\item{normality}{\code{TRUE} it will give an histogram of the residuals, a qq-plot of the residuals and
a scatterplot between the fitted values and the the actual values of the dependent variable is also included.}

\item{outnorm}{\code{TRUE} will give a panel with 6 diagrams for the residuals in \code{outliers} and in \code{normality} together.}

\item{regressors}{\code{TRUE} one or more than one scatter plot regarding each independent variable and the residuals will be produced.}

\item{lmobject}{a fitted regression model from \code{lm}. With only this argument the function will print out all the plots one by one.}
}
\description{
At least seven plots can be produced in one panel.
This function prints out a table with plots similar to the one generated by SAS
as well as one by one diagram describing and analyzing the residuals from a linear regression.
}
\examples{
library(regkurs)
lmfit = lm(nRides ~ temp + hum + windspeed, data = bike)
res.diagnostics(lmfit) #all the plots one by one
res.diagnostics(lmfit,block=T)#all the plots in one panel
res.diagnostics(lmfit,outliers=T)#only the first three plots
}
